Online shopping system in C# using slqite. All changes are currently on the dev branch. Group uni project 

# Issues
Our project is not able to run completely. We have all the functionality written; however, when we try to add an item to the cart 
from the inventory, it will timeout and the error will popup saying "database is locked." We could not figure out the
solution after hours of debugging, and therefore we were not able to fully debug the rest of the project.
